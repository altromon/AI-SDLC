## 4. Evaluation Criteria and Standards
- **McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity (CC)**: Number of linearly independent paths.
- **Maintainability Index (SEI MI)**: Normalized formula [0 - 100] combining Halstead Volume, CC, and LOC.
- **Automated Test Coverage**: Passively ingested from `coverage/coverage-summary.json` or `lcov.info` when present.
- **Clean Code Guardrails**: Prohibition of implicit `any` typing, function length limits ($\le 40$ lines), and zero unjustified suppressions.
