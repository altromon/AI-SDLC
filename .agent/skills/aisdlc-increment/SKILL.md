# aisdlc-increment (Bounded SDD Feature & Bugfix Delivery Playbook)

Canonical Reference: [`process/06_spec_driven_development.md`](../../process/06_spec_driven_development.md), [`process/08_citation_contract_and_drift.md`](../../process/08_citation_contract_and_drift.md), [`process/10_quality_management_and_release_gates.md`](../../process/10_quality_management_and_release_gates.md), [`process/11_git_branching_and_lifecycle.md`](../../process/11_git_branching_and_lifecycle.md), and [`process/09_agent_protocols.md`](../../process/09_agent_protocols.md).

## Purpose & Trigger
Use this skill for **every evolutionary increment (new feature, enhancement, refactoring, or bugfix)** on a project that already has an AI-SDLC baseline. It enforces strict 360° traceability from upstream ProductShape (`UC-*`, `FR-*`) through SDD (`CHG-*`, `HOF-*`, `TSK-*`), TDD implementation, the 12 Quality Gates, and baseline promotion under the **streamlined 2-checkpoint architecture**.

## End-to-End Execution Playbook

### Step 1: Upstream Product, Security & Privacy Delta (`agent-product-analyst`, `agent-threat-modeler` & `agent-privacy-officer`)
1. Inspect active changes via MCP tool `get_active_handoff` and verify whether the target Use Case (`UC-*`) or Requirement (`FR-*`) already exists in `specs/product/`.
2. If the increment introduces new behavior or modifies business rules:
   - Use [`agent-product-analyst`](../agent-product-analyst/SKILL.md) to create or update the `UC-*`, `BR-*`, and `FR-*` (with `@nominal`, `@boundary`, `@invalid` Gherkin scenarios).
   - Run MCP tool `verify_duplicates` (`npx aisdlc verify duplicates`) to block lexical or functional collisions early.
   - Use [`agent-threat-modeler`](../agent-threat-modeler/SKILL.md) to model any new `ABUSE-*` and `SEC-REQ-*` mitigations.
   - Hand off to [`agent-privacy-officer`](../agent-privacy-officer/SKILL.md) to model any personal data assets (`DATA-ASSET-*`), GDPR Art. 30 processing activities (`PRIV-ROPA-*`), and privacy requirements (`PRIV-REQ-*`).
3. Run `sdd_check_fix` (`npx aisdlc check --fix`) to sync Gherkin `.feature` files and validate schemas.

### Step 2: SDD Change Scaffolding & Architectural Design (`agent-system-architect`)
1. Scaffold the bounded change package and its cryptographic `handoff.yaml` sidecar (`HOF-*`) targeting **a single Use Case (`1 UC-* = 1 CHG-*`)** using MCP tool `sdd_change_new` (or CLI `npx aisdlc change new "<Title>" --from <UC-ID> --profile <patch|standard|critical>`).
2. Use [`agent-system-architect`](../agent-system-architect/SKILL.md) to complete `specs/changes/active/<chg-id>/design.md` and `specs/architecture/CMP-*.md`:
   - Structure `CMP-*` and `design.md` around **Modular & Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)** (Domain/Application Core + Inbound/Outbound Ports) and define **Contract-First** shared interfaces/DTOs/schemas when spanning Frontend and Backend.
   - Map 100% of `handoff.yaml` requirements and components to atomic tasks (`TSK-*`) in `tasks.md` with explicit `autonomy-mode` (`AUTONOMOUS`, `HUMAN_REVIEW_PLAN`, `HIGH_RISK_MANUAL`, `AMBIGUOUS`).
3. Run `verify_governance` and `verify_friction` to validate task governance, 100% design/handoff scope coverage, and anti-monolith limits (`maxUseCasesPerChange = 1`).

### Checkpoint 1: Specification & Design Checkpoint (`agent-auditor` $\parallel$ `agent-adversary`)
1. Concurrently invoke `agent-auditor` (evaluating YAGNI, interface bloat, and task completeness) and `agent-adversary` (probing contradictions, race conditions, and architecture SPOFs) in clean, isolated context windows over the combined upstream deliverables.
2. Consolidate findings and remediate any blocking defects (max 2 correction rounds).
3. **Human Approval Gate 1**: Present the specification and architectural design for Human Tech Lead / PO sign-off before proceeding to code.

### Step 3: Streamlined Git Branch Navigation & Multi-Agent Parallelism
1. Navigate to the working branch using `npx aisdlc git checkout <TSK-ID>` (`pnpm run git:checkout <TSK-ID>`).
   - **Default Streamlined Mode**: Switches to the working branch `feat/<CHG-ID>-<slug>` (created from `main`).
   - Granular task traceability is maintained via commit trailers (`Task-ID: TSK-*`, `Parent-Ref: CHG-*`) and commit scopes (`feat(TSK-001): ...`), enabling per-task rework KPIs without branch explosion.
2. **Parallel Agent Execution Rules (`--parallel`)**:
   - When concurrent multi-agent implementation is configured (e.g. Backend adapter $\parallel$ Frontend UI), `aisdlc git checkout <TSK-ID> --parallel` creates isolated worktrees (`task/<PARENT-ID>/<TSK-ID>-<slug>`).

### Step 4: Red Phase — Failing Test Suites (`agent-qa-engineer`)
1. Delegate to or adopt [`agent-qa-engineer`](../agent-qa-engineer/SKILL.md).
2. Author FAILING (red) BDD/Gherkin step definitions, integration/contract tests, and mandatory E2E/UI tests (evaluating Happy Path, Sad Path, and Boundary Values for every interactive UI element, plus `UC-*` alternative/exception flows) in `tests/`.
3. Commit failing test suites with trailer `Task-ID: TSK-YYY`.
4. Run `verify_testing` (`npx aisdlc verify testing`) to confirm requirement test coverage before writing production code.

### Step 5: Green & Refactor Phase — Surgical Implementation (`agent-developer`)
1. Delegate to or adopt [`agent-developer`](../agent-developer/SKILL.md).
2. Execute the **Mandatory 4-Step Implementation Order**:
   - (1) Modular & Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) boundaries, (2) Inter-module interfaces/ports first, (3) Concrete component implementation (zero fake-wiring; all 4 UI states `Loading`, `Empty`, `Error`, `Nominal`), (4) Exhaustive per-function unit tests in `tests/unit/` (Happy Path, Sad Path, Boundary, Null/Empty).
3. Commit implementations with trailer `Task-ID: TSK-YYY`.
4. Verify any new dependency against `license-policy.yaml` via `verify_licenses` and PII handling against `privacy-policy.yaml` via `verify_privacy`.
5. Run `sdd_check_fix` (`npx aisdlc check --fix`) and `verify_quality` (`npx aisdlc verify quality`) until Cyclomatic Complexity $\le 10$, Cognitive $\le 15$, Maintainability $\ge 50$, and Function Length $\le 40$ lines pass with zero violations.
6. Run `verify` (`npx aisdlc verify all`) confirming all **12 Quality Gates** pass green.

### Checkpoint 2: Implementation & Pre-PR Checkpoint (`agent-auditor` $\parallel$ `agent-adversary`)
1. **Functional Validation (`agent-expert-user`)**: Validate live runtime behavior against `UC-*` and `FR-*` criteria (including `0` browser `console.error`/`pageerror` on UI changes).
2. Concurrently invoke `agent-auditor` (verifying Clean Code, SOLID, DRY, AST thresholds, and eliminating unnecessary abstractions) and `agent-adversary` (performing conceptual test mutation to verify QA tests catch defects, and attacking boundary inputs with concrete PoC breaks).
3. Consolidate findings and remediate in `agent-developer` (max 2 correction rounds).
4. Run `npx aisdlc verify all` to confirm final green status.

### Step 6: Human PR Sign-Off, Baseline Integration & Release Closure
1. **Feature Merge (`feat/CHG-*` ➔ `main` or `release/vX.Y.Z`)**:
   - Present the PR, KPI summary (`kpi_pr` including per-task rework metrics), and autogenerated reports (`reports/QUALITY_REPORT.md`, `reports/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md`, `reports/ROPA_INVENTORY.md`) to the human Tech Lead for review and approval (never auto-approve or auto-merge).
2. **Canonical Baseline Promotion**: Once tasks in `tasks.md` are marked `COMPLETED` and approved, promote the change into the canonical baseline via MCP tool `sdd_integrate` (`npx aisdlc sdd integrate --auto`), which synchronizes the normative text and BDD Gherkin scenarios into `FR-*` / `UC-*` / `SEC-REQ-*` / `PRIV-REQ-*`, bumps minor SemVer when updating active specs, resyncs PDaC SHA-256 digests, promotes `FR-*` to `active`, links `CMP-*`, and archives the change under `specs/changes/completed/` (or `npx aisdlc sdd integrate --all` to consolidate all completed changes).
3. **Semantic Versioning Promotion**: Tag the merge with the computed SemVer bump (`patch`, `minor`, `major`) and refresh the interactive dashboard (`report_dashboard`).

## Non-Negotiable Guardrails
- **Clean Context Window Isolation per Specialist Agent (Cross-IDE)**: Never execute two distinct specialist roles (e.g., `agent-qa-engineer` and `agent-developer`, or `agent-developer` and `agent-security-auditor`) in the same conversation context window. In subagent-capable IDEs (Antigravity `invoke_subagent`, Claude Code `Task` / `.claude/agents/`, GitHub Copilot `@agent-*`), always spawn each specialist in a fresh isolated subagent context that reads state strictly from disk (`specs/`, `handoff.yaml`, `get_active_handoff`). In chat-based IDEs (Cursor, Windsurf, Aider), persist all artifacts to disk, emit the Workflow Handoff block, and instruct the user to open a **New Chat** (or `/clear`) before running the next specialist.
- **2-Checkpoint Quality & Adversarial Protocol**: Enforce transversal quality and red-team checks exclusively at **Checkpoint 1 (Specification & Design)** and **Checkpoint 2 (Implementation & Pre-PR)**. Enforce the **Anti-Ping-Pong Guardrail**: maximum 2 correction rounds per checkpoint; if unresolved blocking defects persist, escalate to the Human Tech Lead.
- **Single-Use-Case Scope (`1 UC-* = 1 CHG-*`)**: Each SDD change (`CHG-*`) must deliver at most 1 Use Case (`UC-*`). Bundling multiple `UC-*` into one `handoff.yaml` is blocked by `verify_governance` (`Greenfield monolith detected`). Scale throughput via parallel `CHG-*` branches/worktrees, not monolithic changes.
- **100% Design & Handoff Coverage in `tasks.md`**: Every `CMP-*`, `FR-*`, `SEC-REQ-*`, and `PRIV-REQ-*` declared in `design.md` and `handoff.yaml` must be explicitly assigned to at least one `TSK-*` in `tasks.md`.
