# Delivery Specification: CHG-NAME-001

## 1. Catalog Scope and Traceability (Canonical Alignment)

> **MANDATORY SPECIFICATION RULE (ZERO AMBIGUITY / 360° TRACEABILITY):**  
> Every delivery increment (`spec.md`) MUST explicitly declare the exact boundaries of its impact across the canonical catalog (`product/`, `security/`, and `architecture/`).  
> An increment cannot author code or tests for unmapped behaviors. It must explicitly declare:
> - **Affected Existing Catalog Items:** Existing functional requirements (`FR-*`), use cases (`UC-*`), actors (`ACT-*`), business rules (`BR-*`), security requirements (`SEC-REQ-*`), or architecture components/ADRs (`CMP-*`, `ADR-*`, `SRV-*`) whose behavior, contracts, or constraints are modified or deprecated.
> - **New Catalog Items Introduced:** Any new functional requirements, use cases, actors, architecture decisions, or security rules created by this increment, identifying their proposed IDs and target catalog destination.

### 1.1 Affected Existing Catalog Items (Modifications / Deprecations)

| Catalog Category | Catalog ID | Action (`MODIFIED` / `DEPRECATED`) | Description of Delta & Behavioral Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Functional Requirement | `FR-EXISTING-001` | `MODIFIED` | Extends validation rules to support batch payload ingestion |
| Use Case | `UC-EXISTING-001` | `MODIFIED` | Adds alternative execution path for handling throttling limits |
| Actor / Persona | `ACT-EXISTING-001` | `MODIFIED` | Expands authorization scope to access batch processing endpoints |
| Architecture / Component | `CMP-CORE-001` | `MODIFIED` | Ingestion pipeline updated to support non-blocking asynchronous dispatch |

### 1.2 New Catalog Items Introduced (Additions)

| Catalog Category | Proposed ID | Target Catalog Location | Formal Scope & Functional Contract |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Functional Requirement | `FR-NEW-001` | `product/requirements/` | Automated cryptographic signature verification for incoming telemetry |
| Use Case | `UC-NEW-001` | `product/use-cases/` | End-to-end telemetry subscription and streaming workflow |
| Actor / Persona | `ACT-NEW-001` | `product/actors/` | External third-party auditor agent role |
| Architecture Decision / Component | `ADR-005` / `CMP-NEW-001` | `architecture/` | Token bucket sliding-window rate limiting engine |
| Security Requirement | `SEC-REQ-NEW-001` | `security/requirements/` | Enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) with client certificate validation |

## 2. Requirement Deltas and Formal Contracts

For each affected or new catalog item declared above, define the concrete functional delta:

### [FR-NAME-001 / FR-NEW-001]: [Requirement Title]
* **Operation:** `[ADDED | MODIFIED | DEPRECATED]`
* **Primary Actor(s):** `ACT-ACTOR-001`
* **Associated Use Case(s):** `UC-ACTION-001`
* **Architectural Scope:** `CMP-NAME-001` (Security Enclave: `SEC-ENC-DMZ`)
* **Behavioral Contract (Delta Specification):**
  * **Baseline (Before):** Describes previous behavior or states "None (New requirement)".
  * **Target Delta (After):** Explicit behavioral specification of the new or altered behavior.

## 3. Functional Behavior Scenarios (BDD Gherkin)

```gherkin
@CHG-NAME-001 @FR-NAME-001 @UC-ACTION-001 @functional @automated
Feature: Delivery Specification CHG-NAME-001
  As a [primary actor / system role: ACT-ACTOR-001]
  I want [functional capability delivered by this change: FR-NAME-001]
  So that [expected business value or outcome]

  Background:
    Given the system is in a nominal operational state
    And dependent services are available

  Scenario: Nominal successful flow
    Given the client has established an authenticated session for "ACT-ACTOR-001"
    When valid payload is submitted according to specification
    Then the server responds with status 200 OK and persists state

  Scenario Outline: Parameter and edge case validation
    Given an input with parameter "<param>"
    When the request is processed
    Then the system returns status "<status>"

    Examples:
      | param   | status |
      | nominal | 200    |
      | invalid | 400    |
```

## 4. Cybersecurity and Mitigation Scenarios (Abuse Scenarios)

```gherkin
@CHG-NAME-001 @security @mitigation @SEC-REQ-CONTROL-001
Feature: Threat Mitigation and Abuse Scenarios
  Scenario: Unauthorized access or unauthenticated payload attempt
    Given a malicious actor attempts to send data without valid credentials
    When connection attempts to reach protected enclaves "SEC-ENC-DMZ"
    Then handshake is aborted immediately and security alert SEC-TEST-001 is emitted
```
