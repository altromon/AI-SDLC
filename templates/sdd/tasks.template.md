# Verifiable Tasks Breakdown: CHG-001-FEATURE-NAME

## 1. Autonomy Classification and Human Supervision Matrix

Each task is rigorously classified according to its complexity and risk level to determine the level of delegation to AI agents:

| Autonomy Mode | Traffic Light | Activation Criterion | Agent and Human Behavior |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **`AUTONOMOUS`** | 🟢 | Low risk, isolated and well-specified task with immediate tests. | **Autonomous Plan + Execution**. Agent creates plan and writes code without interruption. Human validates final PR. |
| **`HUMAN_REVIEW_PLAN`** | 🟡 | Medium risk, architectural changes, API contracts, or critical business rules. | **Mandatory Plan Review**. Agent designs detailed plan, but halts. **Human must approve plan before coding.** |
| **`AMBIGUOUS`** | 🟠 | Vague requirements, incomplete criteria, or conflicting business logic. | **Blocked for Implementation**. Agent is forbidden to guess. Requires prior interview and refinement with user. |
| **`HIGH_RISK_MANUAL`** | 🔴 | Critical risk (destructive DB migrations, cryptographic keys, production infra). | **Autonomous Execution Forbidden**. Direct human execution or assisted mode with command-by-command confirmation. |

## 2. Detailed Task Plan and Verification Criteria

### Phase 1: Types and Contracts (TSK-001)
- **ID**: `TSK-001`
- **Description**: Create interfaces and data structures stipulated in `design.md`.
- **Mode**: `AUTONOMOUS` 🟢
- **Verification**: `npx tsc --noEmit && node packages/cli/bin/aisdlc.js verify quality`

### Phase 2: Implementation and BDD Tests (TSK-002)
- **ID**: `TSK-002`
- **Description**: Implement business logic and pass Cucumber scenarios.
- **Mode**: `HUMAN_REVIEW_PLAN` 🟡
- **Verification**: `npx cucumber-js tests/features/feature.feature`

### Phase 3: Critical Operations / Deployment (TSK-003)
- **ID**: `TSK-003`
- **Description**: Apply migrations or perimeter enclave configurations.
- **Mode**: `HIGH_RISK_MANUAL` 🔴
- **Verification**: Manual approval checklists and smoke tests (`smoke-test`).
